About Me: "My name is Chiranjeet Swain, and I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science and Engineering from CV Raman Global University, where I achieved a CGPA of 7.71.
I have hands-on experience in data science and front-end development, having completed internships that provided me with practical skills in Python programming, data analytics, advanced Excel, and web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
During my internships, I worked on projects like developing a lead score case study for an education company and building a Spotify clone, which enhanced my abilities in data visualization, user interface design, and efficient data handling.
I am proficient in using SQL for complex data queries and have also created dashboards using Power BI to provide valuable business insights.
I am passionate about using my technical skills to solve real-world problems and contribute to impactful projects.
